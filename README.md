# Single-Cycle CPU Implementation
This project showcases the development of a single-cycle Central Processing Unit (CPU) using VHDL and synthesized with Xilinx Vivado 2016.3. The CPU processes 16-bit instructions with a design optimized to avoid data, structural, and timing hazards, ensuring smooth cycle execution. Behavioral simulations confirm that the fetch, decode, execute, and write-back phases operate correctly and sequentially without overflow errors.

The CPUâ€™s hierarchical structure includes essential components like an ALU, Program Counter (PC), and memory blocks, enabling efficient instruction execution. Unlike multi-cycle or pipelined CPUs, this single-cycle CPU completes each instruction in one cycle, providing simplicity at the cost of potential performance trade-offs. PnR was employed for accurate opcode and register management.

What sets this CPU apart is its attention to hazard management . The project emphasizes robust testing through waveform analysis, ensuring register and memory cells update appropriately without errors or data conflicts.

This work highlights the effective synthesis and verification of a single-cycle CPU with proven stability and efficiency. Future steps could explore multi-cycle architectures for comparison and further optimization of power and space for embedded applications.
