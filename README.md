# CPU_FinalProject
I created a Central Processing Unit in VHDL on Vivado software to execute various operations via Single-Cycle Implementation. It receives 16-bit instruction vectors as inputs to then divide them into memory addresses, inputs and op-codes. The results will be written back to the register memory or main memory depending on the type of instruction.
